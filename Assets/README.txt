Welcome to the Tic Toc Unity 3D test!

This project will assess your understanding of basic 3D concepts in Unity and your ability to implement gameplay mechanics such as movement, jumping and collision detection.

Your goal is to create a small interactive 3D environment in Unity that demonstrates the following gameplay mechanics:
- Player Movement: Implement basic character controls for movement in 3D space (forward, backward, left, right and jump).
- Coin collecting: Passing over coins should destroy them and update a UI element showing how many coins the player has collected so far.
- Click-to-Fire Projectile: Player can fire a projectile while in first-person view.
	- Player should only be able to fire AFTER grabbing the gun on top of the platform.
	- Targets should react on impact (either by destroying them, playing an animation or spawning a visual effect)
	- Note: Included camera script can switch between third and first person view by right clicking.
	- Note: Projectile can be represented by a simple shape (e.g., a sphere or cube) or visual effect.


Extra requirements
- Use latest Unity LTS version to import the project.
- Please ensure that your code is clear and well-documented.
- Demonstrate a solid grasp of 3D space, physics, and model-view separation.
- Package your project files for submission, including a short README explaining your implementation approach and any assumptions you made.

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Functionality: Does your project fulfil the outlined requirements?
- Code Quality: Is your code efficient, clean, and well-commented?
- Problem-Solving: How effectively do you handle mechanics such as movement, jumping, and projectile trajectory?
- Flexibility: Can parameters be tweaked to adjust game feel?

Once you’ve completed the assignment please upload your project, including the README explaining your implementation, to a public GitHub repository, archive it and send us a link by the provided deadline.

If you have any questions or need clarification, don’t hesitate to reach out!
